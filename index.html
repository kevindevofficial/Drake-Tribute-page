        <section>Drake has produced many hit songs like for example, 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgs4y8gGOZo">"Best I Ever Had"</a>
            <p>and also</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyv4Bjja8yc">"Find Your Love"</a>
            <p>Drake Drake has won 192 awards, including 4 Grammy Awards from 47 nominations. Also, Drake has won a record 29 awards from 81 nominations on the Billboard Music Awards, including Artist of the Decade.</p>
            <p>Drake also loves spanish women a lot according to some of his twitter posts such as "Jajajaja to all my spanish girls one time." and also "One time tonight for all the spanish girls that say "rarey" instead of very. I am having a drink in your honor.". </p>
            <p>In my opinion this is why he gets so much love and support from many different cultures in the world and I also would like to add that he also has a couple spanish songs like for example<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-eIhp4j0">Odio featuring Romeo Santos</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSUxrSe5GbI">Mia Featuring Bad Bunny.</a></p>
